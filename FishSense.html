            In the above work, my contribution was on the software side of the project, so I will give my input on it. I worked on developing the algorithms responsible for detecting, measuring, and "weighing" the fish.
             I used a combination of the Yolov4 framework and depth data.
             It had a really good success rate, especially when given the right parameters and weights. </p>

             <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;"> Of the many benefits of this system I would like to bring up the efficiency and speed at which it completes previously mundane
              tasks. Previously many researchers would simply sit in towers or go under water with clipboards and rulers to count fish and measure their length. As is obvious this method is incredibly 
              inefficient and is not very accurate.The Fishsense system tries to remedy using state of the art cameras and machine learning algorithms. Currently the 
              system runs at 30 frames per second (FPS). This means that every second 30 pictures of fish are counted and measured. As you can imagine 
              this saves researchers unbelievable amounts of time. The current iteration of the system can count up 30 fish within one image with a relatively high accuracy. So with a maximum of 30 fish per each frame
              so this means that the system can count about 100 fish per second. In addition to the relative speed of the algorithms, the size of the algorithms is also relatively small. Since the software is fitted with
              many different weights it allows the user to only download what they need, rather than only incredibly large set of weights. This allows the software to fit within a couple GB.
               However, despite the numerous success there are always improvements.
            </p>


             <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">The most glaring problem critics may bring up is that the current design is the fact that it requires multiple different weights.
             While having one set of weights would make the program a lot more concise, unfortunately, there aren't catch-all weights that work.
              Despite various datasets, the models weren't able to converge to a very accurate detector. 
              In fact, having many different weights allows the model to be a lot more viable in very different scenarios. 
              While improving the weights with more and more data is always a hope, the current focus and critique of the system lies with its lack of incorporation of depth data. 
              Currently, the pipeline uses the depth data only in the final step to make the length and volumetric measurements. 
              However, the depth data can be used to estimate general regions of interest for fishes. Depending on the fish it may camouflage into the background or travel as part of a group. 
              If this happens then the current model may struggle to get an accurate measurement. It's in these cases where the depth data can help create an accurate detection. 
              In addition in some use cases where we know the detection takes place in a still environment like an aquaculture plant, we are experimenting with motion subtraction techniques. 
              If the current model incorporates the proposed motion subtraction methods the level of success would be unparalleled. 
              Likewise, the system can be improved by using that same depth data to preprocess the images before they are even fed into the model.
             By leveraging existing works used for noise removal in the primary steps the level of accuracy can be greatly improved as well.</p>
