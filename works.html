            The above paper details the YOLOv4 model, the holy grail of computer vision. Computer vision deals with using machine learning to detect, classify and make inferences about something a computer sees. A lot of my work as a machine learning engineering has been in this field, and as a result, I have made extensive use of the framework laid out by the inventors of the YOLOv4 network. The reason that Yolov4 is so remarkable is actually where its name comes from. YOLO stands for "You only look once", meaning that the computer performs all its analysis, classification, etc. in one pass. It doesn't have to go back and solidify its guess. This is incredibly powerful as it allows for real-time detection in ways that are unparalleled. Take a look at this graph with the model's accuracy (on the y-axis) against its speed (on the x-axis):

              </picture>

            </p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">  </p>

            <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;"> Before the Yolov4 model, there was a trade-off between speed and accuracy, making real-time detection incredibly difficult. As a result computer vision as a field was fairly limited when it came to autonomous monitoring. Imagine you are in a car, and it takes 20 seconds for it to realize there is a stop sign in front of it. With YOLOv4 everyone switched to the seemingly amazing model. Even total beginners like I was were able to breach into a field that required years of research and knowledge were able to make models capable of competing with world-class algorithms.

             <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;"> However by giving just about anyone the ability to allow a camera to track anything a lot of people had growing concerns. Many papers, like the one above, came out regarding people's concerns about the amount of power that the common man now possessed. In essence just about anyone could create facial recognition software, credit card reader, etc. This controversy grew so far that one of the creators of the YOLOv4 network retired from computer vision because of the guilt he felt.
              <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">As time passed, and the model got more integrated with the society a lot of people learned that many of them had overreacted. The common man had no more motivation to conduct malicious acts due to the introduction of the network. Many defenders of the Yolo network brought up how if people really wanted to commit malicious acts they could already do it before the YOLOv4, given enough time, and putting restraints on the system only really hurt those trying to enter into the field. Likewise, many people brought up how current systems still had a long way to go until they could still be truly viable. While there still exist critics of the Yolov4 network and computer vision in general, a majority of them want more safety and many researchers aim to satisfy that goal with the improvements in the field of encrypting images, as well as brute force human checks to make them more difficult more computers to detect things. Methods like Recaptcha aim to add regulations to malicious computer vision overtaking all aspects of daily life. Below is a paper that takes about how modern models still mostly fail with the Recaptcha:

            </p>


             <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">All in all the introduction of the YOLOv4 completely shook the computer vision field, but not enough to where society will start falling apart. The network gave beginners an entry into a field that had previously been locked away decades of research and experience. Likewise, the model also brought to attention how much we relied on "I am not a robot" checks like Recaptcha, and made sure that more people utilized them. So while critics will continue to point out the problems with introducing the YOLOv4, currently many people agree it was a net positive.
