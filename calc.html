            <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;"> In the above work, I wanted to see the extent of my coding skills and make an interactable graphing calculator. In my high school calculus class, there was an extra credit project if you
              could out a functioning graphing calculator that could show off the concepts that we had learned in the class. Unfortunately at that time, I had neither the coding skill or calculus skill
              to make a functioning product. Faced with this set back I tried to make a calculator once I learned more. This project is the result of that desire.
            </p>

             <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;"> The assignment in high school gave clear guidelines on what to have the graphing calculator due. As such I used those guidelines as the project 
              specifications for this project. The guidelines in the project were numerous. The first of these was to be able to graph polynomials, including logarithmic, trigonometric, and exponential functions.
              This was fairly difficult and I opted to use the math function to read the given string and convert it into math symbols. This made sure I didn't have to do extensive coding or case checking for each of the 
              math functions that contained letters. Then once I handled the input, I evaluated the function for every x value within my small graph. Then I would simply check if if there was a valid x,y pair at the graph it.
              One foreseeable problem with this is that as the functions get more complex the website will take longer to graph the desired function. However, this is true for any computer so it was not really one of my worries.
              Then once I gave the function I was able to draw the given function with decent accucracy. The next step in the project specifications was to be able to graph the first and second derivatives. For this I made use of
              libraries that could perform derivatization for me and used the same function to draw the original function to draw the first and second derivatives. From here I was also given that I had to show where there potential
              minimums, maximums, and points of inflection in the original function. This was pretty simple as I simpled checked where the first and second derivates evaluated to 0. I then simply had to show this on my graph. For this
              I chose to simply increase the size of the place where the first and second derivatives equaled zero. Next I had to use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus on two given x values. This once again was fairly easy as it was simply
              just evaluating a formula given two parameters. With all these features added I had created a function that could perform the tasks required of a basic graphing calculator. However, as with any project I tried to find places to improve.
              Currently, the function is limited to a window, and if any important behavior happens outside the window it doesn't clearly show. Take for example the line y=x-11. This graph crosses the y-axis at y=-11. Since my graph only goes till y=-10, 
              this doesn't clearly show. Obviously, I could expand the size of my graph, but then it isn't able to compute important features fast enough so this is the balanced trade-off I opted for.
            </p>
