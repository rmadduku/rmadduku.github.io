            <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">  This project spawned from how annoying it is to type mathematical equations into online calculators or editors. If not for interpretation languages like Latex, then writing mathematical equations would be a nightmare. As a result, I wanted to make a more usable way to transfer math from paper to the computer. Likewise, since I was already reading the mathematical equation, I figured it would only make sense to also evaluate the given equation as well.</p>

            </picture>
            <p style="width: x; text-align: center;">Pictured above is an example of a what I would like to read and solve</p>

             <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">As with all my projects I first listed out a general project structure and what I considered to be vital steps. The first one would definitely be the detection of numbers and special characters. I made use of the TesseractCOR framework to detect each of the numbers and letters. From here I would then have to make sense of the given equations and convert them into actual mathematical phrases. Once that had been done, I would simply use one of the many math libraries Python has, and evaluate the given math equation.
            </p>

             <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;"> Since I was dealing with handwritten digits I knew that it would always be a dark-colored text against a light background. I applied a thresholding algorithm to the image so it made the handwritten digits a lot easier to detect. I then got a binary image which I then applied morphological transformations. I essentially closed all the gaps and made the images a lot easier to discern by making the features more readable. Here is the result of that program: </p>

              <img src="assets/img/jpg-png/quad_thresh.PNG" alt="pipeline"style="margin-left: 0px;">
            </picture>
            <p style="width: x; text-align: center;">Pictured above is the result of the thresholding</p>
  

          <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">With a binary image, I used contour detection to find all the important characters within the given image. Contour detection worked especially well since it made use of the white characters against the black background.</p>

            <img src="assets/img/jpg-png/quadcon.PNG" alt="pipeline"style="margin-left: 0px;">
          </picture>
          <p style="width: x; text-align: center;">Pictured above is the result of the contour detection</p>

      <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">
      </p>

      <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">With the contours, I used TesseractCOR to read each of the characters. I then passed the assembled equation through a basic calculator code that I had written. I got a lot of inspiration from this leetcode discussion thread: <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/discuss/62361/Iterative-Java-solution-with-stack">Inspiration here.</a>Unfortunately, this basic calculator only really helped when x had a single degree. For when the equation was quadratic, or cubic, I used made use of quadratic and cubic formulas.  <a href="https://math.vanderbilt.edu/schectex/courses/cubic/">Formulas here.</a>

        <img src="assets/img/jpg-png/solved.PNG" alt="pipeline"style="margin-left: 0px;">
      </picture>
      <p style="width: x; text-align: center;">Pictured above is the result of the equation</p>
      <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;"> Currently, this program could probably pass a grade school math test. But that isn't enough, there are plenty of improvements that are readily obvious. The first is that the solver only really works on well-written digits, so it may not be as accessible as I would like it to be. Another is that the program only really works on first, second, and third-degree equations. This can definitely be improved in the future. Likewise, the program also fails when it comes to special equations like cosine, or logarithms. I haven't really accounted for written characters other than x, so the infrastructure for detecting these special functions still needs to be coded.</p>
