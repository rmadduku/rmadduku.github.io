        <h3>Raghav Maddukuri</h3>
        <p class="font-italic">Machine Learning Researcher at UCSD | Mathematics-Computer Science @ UCSD</p>
        <p>Hello, I am a student at the University of California - San Diego pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mathematics-Computer Science.
          I am interested in using machine learning and software engineering to further refine autonomous vehicles. I hope to use my numerous
          experiences in computer vision to help develop and grow the industry.</p>
        <p> My interest in computer science came from my interest in problem solving and my desire to eliminate a lot of humanity's difficulties. Growing up I would always find my self playing with Rubix Cubes or solving Sudokus, always
          pushing the limits of what I could achieve. As I grew older this interest in problem solving grew into a desire to learn and use math to solve the worlds the problems. Eventually as I learned how integrated computers are with today's society this desire 
        manifested as a desire in computer science. For me I saw myself given access to the most powerful piece of technology ever created, and I knew I had to make full use of it to advance our society forwards.  </p>
        <p>My desire in machine learning actually stemmed from my disdain for driving. I never really liked driving, and always thought about all the things I could be doing in the meantime, and it was only natural for me to think if there was a solution to my driving dislike through computer science.
          As you can put together, I came across the field of autonomous vehicles, and more generally the field of computer vision, the field of using machine learning on camera data to make inferences of observed phenomena. With thi interest, I spent a lot of my free time working to learn and improve my skills.
          This lead me to the Yolov4 paper detailing the revolutionary detection system. From here my future was basically settled. I saw so much potential behind this revolutionary system, and sought to better as many people's lives using this technology. In fact, most of my personal projects are the result of this desire to help others.
        </p>
        <p>One of my biggest accomplishments is joining the UCSD E4E research group. As one of the younger members on the team, I am forced to quickly adapt and learn new skills.
          In the past several months I have gone from little Python knowledge to getting published for my work in underwater computer vision.
          Regardless of the challenges that I will face, I know that because of my demanding workplace, I will be able to adapt and put my best foot forward.</p>
        <p>This website is dedicated to showing off my skills as both a computer scientist and as a Machine learning Engineer. Please explore the project descriptions, even trying out the ones that
          have been coded with interactive interfaces. IF you like the work that I have put out, please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or shoot me an email.
