            <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;"> For this project I wanted to tackle the problem of people improperly wearing masks. In light of the coronavirus, I wanted to make sure that people proper COVID-19 prevention practices.

            </picture>
            <p style="width: x; text-align: center;">Pictured above is an example of a person wearing a mask that I would like to recognize.</p>

             <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">For this project, I wanted to do more than simply check if a person was wearing a mask. There are some masks that technically qualify as masks, but they are a poor excuse for a mask. For example:

            </p>
            <picture>
              <source type="image/webp" srcset="assets/img/webp/fake.webp" style="margin-left: 0px;">
              <img src="assets/img/jpg-png/fake.png" alt="pipeline"style="margin-left: 0px;">
            </picture>
            <p style="width: x; text-align: center;">Pictured above is an example of a mask that I considered invalid</p>

             <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">So first I made sure to make an outline of what I considered a valid mask-wearing. I made a list of all the things that made a person wear a mask incorrectly. If they wore a mask in a way that we could see their nose or mouth, they wore it incorrectly. Likewise, If they wore a mask that wasn't an actual mask, say a scarf or just a bit of their shirt pulled up, that was also invalid.
            </p>
          <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">The first of the project specifications that I tackled was simply finding if someone was wearing a mask or not. For this, I used a Yolov4 convolutional neural network for the blend of accuracy and real-time detection. I eventually want people to be able to run this program on something like a security camera to see if visitors to their store, home, etc. are wearing a mask. </p>
          <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;"> Using the yolov4 I was able to create a cropped image that only had the area where the predicted mask was. Once I got this I had another yolov4 network trained to detect noses, mouths, and scarfs.</p>
            
          <picture>
            <source type="image/webp" srcset="assets/img/webp/scarf.webp" style="margin-left: 0px;">
            <img src="assets/img/jpg-png/scarf.PNG" alt="pipeline"style="margin-left: 0px;">
          </picture>
        </picture>
        <p style="width: x; text-align: center;">Pictured above is an example of someone using a scarf as a max, that I considered invalid</p>
      <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;"> Now I use a personal scoring algorithm that I came up with to give each photo a percentage of how well they were wearing their mask. For this scoring algorithm, I made use of the checks I made before, as well as the accuracy of each of those detections. I first evaluated the accuracy of the mask detected and used that as a base number that I then subtracted from. If I saw a nose I subtracted 20 times the accuracy percentage of the detection. I then did the same with a detected mouth but used 60 as a possible maximum. So if someone wore a mask that showed their nose and mouth they would earn a maximum of 20%. Likewise, I wanted to penalize people who cheated their mask-wearing with a scarf or a bit of cloth. For the people that wore a scarf, I put an upper cap of 50 times the detected accuracy.



      </p>
      <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">With this project, the general pipeline is incredibly streamlined. However, I am performing a solo detection twice when it seems a little overkill. With new variants, some doctors are recommending only the N95 mask as the only viable option. With this, it would be really easy to detect if a person was wearing an N95 using feature matching. I would simply upload a picture of an N95, and see if something similar is found in the given picture.</p>
