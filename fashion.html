            <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;"> For this project, I tackled the subject problem of fashion. Personally, I suck at dressing fashionably, instead opting for a simple t-shirt and jeans. So to help with my fashion problem I made a program that could evaluate how good my dress was using color contrast between your shirt, pants, and shoes. I had seen color dressing guides online and I made use of them to make my algorithm.</p>

            </picture>
            <p style="width: x; text-align: center;">Pictured above is an example of a color dressing guide.</p>

             <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">As with any project I created a step-by-step guide for how I would approach this project. I knew that since I wanted to do more than just a simple color finder I had to isolate the top, bottom, and shoes. For this, I opted to use a yolov4 that detected tops, bottoms, and shows, by training it on data that I annotated from Google's Open Images Dataset. With a clear bounding box around each of the pieces of clothing, I would then need to somehow evaluate the color that someone was wearing. Since some clothing could have many different colors or very small traces, I made a primary and secondary color for each piece of clothing. I also set minimums and had a very simple blob detector run on the clothing, This blob detection was to detect if there was something like dirt or food smudges that were readily obvious. I subtracted ten points from the total score for each smudge I found.
            </p>

             <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;"> Now that I had isolated each piece of clothing, I had to find the primary and secondary clothing. For this, I made an array of values containing all the colors on the left of the color chart. Then I simply went through each of the pixels in the detected pieces of clothing and found the corresponding Red, Green, and Blue, (RGB) values. I then allowed a plus-minus of 25 in each of the values of R,G, B for each pixel allowing for different shades than what I had set for each of the colors. To figure out which were my primary and secondary colors, I counted the number of pixels that corresponded to each color, and let the most, and second most be the primary and secondary colors. If the secondary color didn't pass a certain minimum, or there wasn't a clear second place, I just assumed there wasn't a definite secondary color.</p>

          <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">Now with the primary and secondary colors of each piece of clothing, I created a list of 6 colors. From this list of 6 colors, I consulted the color chart to see how complimentary each of the colors was. I used the chart pictured above and simply gave each color an equal weight. If I had repeats more than three times, meaning that someone was wearing the same color in their top, bottom and shoes, I deducted from the final score. Using the metric from before combined with infractions, I output a final score for the person's attire.</p>

          <p style="width: x; text-align: center;">Pictured above is the result of the program</p>

      <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">While this project works to some extent, it is purely for fun, and isn't meant to be taken seriously for clothing. With that in mind, I did want to see if I could improve it further. The one largest problem I had with the color evaluation was suits. Suits were typically one color like black or grey throughout the top, bottom and shows. As a result my program evaluated them very low since it had no color contrast. For example:</p>
      <picture>
        <source type="image/webp" srcset="assets/img/webp/meh.webp" style="margin-left: 0px;">
        <img src="assets/img/jpg-png/meh.jpg" alt="pipeline"style="margin-left: 0px;">
      </picture>
      <p style="width: x; text-align: center;">Pictured above is a result I want to improve.</p>
      <p style="width: 1220px; text-align: left;">I think I just have to do more research into the fashion field before I can make a program that can evaluate fashion. I based this entire program off my incredibly limited fashion knowledge, and as a result it is incredibly limited in its results. In future iterations I will make more exhaustive checks of clothing and be able to give a better score.</p>
